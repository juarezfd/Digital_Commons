Introduction to Altair in Python

Altair is a statistically visualization library in Python.
Declarative in nature and based on Vega and Vega-lite JSON visualization grammars.
Easy choice for quick and efficient way to visualize datasets. 
With Altair, you can spend more time understanding your data and its meaning.

Structurally different from MatPlotLib, an imparative visualization library.
In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm style of 
building the structure and elements of computer programs that expresses the logic of a 
computation without describing its control flow.

Declarative programs describe what is accomplished rather than describing how to do something
	- e.g., SQL (i.e., database query language), regular expressions, logic programming, functional programming
Declarative:
	- Declarative code is where you say what you want done. The system assumes some steps through backend code.
	- what this looks like in DataViz is you asking it to make a line graphe giving it data that is in the 
	x-axis vs y-axis. You need your data in a format that the language recognizes.

Imperative:
	- imperative code is where you explicitly spell out each step of how you want something done. 
	the program wont assume anythig for you
	- 
	- what this will look like is in DataViz is you super imposing various different aspects of a graph (i.e., axis, scale, type bar/line, title, legend, etc)

Explaining Altair

Data
The dataset is the first argument that you pass to the chart. 
Data in Altair is built around the Pandas Dataframe so the encoding becomes 
quite simple and it is able to detect the data types required in the encoding 
but you can also use the following for the data:

- A Data or related object such as UrlData, InlineData, NamedData
- A json or csv formatted text file or url
- An object that supports the __geo_interface__(eg. Geopandas GeoDataFrame, GeoJSON Objects)

Using DataFrames will make the process easier, so you should use DataFrames wherever possible.

Altair works well with Pandas for anyone looking for a reason to combine data analyzing with DataViz
compliment one another well

Altair uses Vega and VegaLite in the backend which deals with JSON. Meaning that these plots you create are 
already in a format ready to publish online in a site if possible through JavaScript embedding

JS is a core programming language of the WWW alongside HTML and CSS. 
Over 97% of sites use JS on the client side for the webpage.
All web browsers have a dedicated JS engine to execute the code on the user's device
